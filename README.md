# My Portfolio Site
This is my portfolio! I update this site regularly with projects that I have worked on. It includes links to all of my socials and my resume as well!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this page from scratch using HTML and CSS. I based it off of the [Gossip Girl website from the original 2007 show](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/i/d25ec84f-b519-427f-8f88-12a1c17f6c0e/de2k50w-fd1e7aae-c3d0-4fe3-ad6b-47812e54d325.jpg). 

## Optimizations

I am working to make this site more responsive with better looking modals.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first big project using CSS transforms and animations. It was a lot of fun and I very pleased with the outcome!
