# My Portfolio Site
This is my portfolio! I update this site regularly with projects that I have worked on. It includes links to all of my socials and my resume as well!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started with a template from HTML5Up.net and modfied the HTML and CSS. I love purple and just had to have that represented across the page! 

## Optimizations

I removed a lot of fluff on the page and some uneeded modals and asides. I wanted the page to load quickly and get right to the point. 

## Lessons Learned:

I had never really used Font Awesome until this project and it was great learning about it. It really helped with the coloring of the social media icons and making everything look clean!
